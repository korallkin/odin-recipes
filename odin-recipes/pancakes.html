    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a
        starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or
        frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that
        pancakes were probably eaten in prehistoric societies</p>
    <p>
        The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. In North America, a leavening agent is used (typically
        baking powder) creating a thick fluffy pancake. A crepe is a thin Breton pancake of French origin cooked on one
        or both sides in a special pan
        or crepe maker to achieve a network of fine bubbles.
