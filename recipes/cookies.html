    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Cookies are most commonly baked until crisp or else for just long enough to ensure soft interior. Other types of
        cookies are not baked at all, such as varieties of peanut butter cookies that use solidified chocolate rather
        than set eggs and wheat gluten as a binder. Cookies are produced in a wide variety of styles, using an array
        of ingredients including sugars, spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts, or dried fruits.
    </p>
    <p>
        A general theory of cookies may be formulated in the following way. Despite its descent from cakes and other
        sweetened breads, the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in
        cakes serves to make the batter as thin as possible, the better to allow bubbles—responsible for a cake's
        fluffiness—to form. In the cookie the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil. Oils, whether in the form
        of butter, vegetable oils, or lard, are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a far higher
        temperature. Thus a cake made with butter or eggs in place of water is much denser after removal from the oven.

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup shortening</li>
        <li>½ cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>

                Cream shortening, peanut butter, and both sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and
                fluffy. Beat in egg until incorporated. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate
                bowl; gradually stir into peanut butter mixture until combined. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least
                1 hour.

                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

                Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Flatten dough
                balls with a fork dipped in flour to form a crosswise pattern.

                Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to
                cool completely.
