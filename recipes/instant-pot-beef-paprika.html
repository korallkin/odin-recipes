        Also known as “beef paprika,” this dish gets much of its lovely russet hue and flavor from paprika. <strong>It's
            beefy
            and saucy and full of tasty flavor.</strong> We love to eat it over mashed potatoes, like a full roast
        dinner!

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Turn on a 6- or 8-quart multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute
                function. Add olive oil and meat, season with salt and pepper, and saute in batches until browned, 5 to
                7 minutes per batch. Remove meat to a plate. Add onion and garlic to the pot and cook until tender and
                fragrant, about 5 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Return meat to the pot and stir in 1 1/4 cups water, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, salt,
                paprika, dry mustard, cayenne pepper, and hot pepper sauce. Cancel Saute function.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 15
                minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10
                minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Blend remaining 1/4 cup water with flour in a small bowl. Gradually stir into the meat mixture and
                select Saute function. Heat until thickened, about 5 minutes.
